### Welcome 👋

My name is Daniel Ronan, I live in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 and I am currently studying and building my skills in Software Development. Here you will find my repositories, which will include many collaborative projects and my 'solo projects' that I have completed on the 'Microverse Software Development Course'. There will be many more to come so please feel free to have a look around! 😁

🌱 I’m currently learning 'Ruby' 🔴💎

👯 If you want to collaborate then please feel free to get in touch!

👀 I'm looking for an opportunity as a Full-Stack Software Developer in London 💂. I am also open to being 'Remote' 💻 .
